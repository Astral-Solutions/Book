            Why Literacy Material Donation Matters
          </h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            Quality materials improve reading outcomes. They help learners build vocabulary, improve comprehension, and grow in confidence. Yet for many learners in South Africa, these resources are simply not accessible. Through this initiative, we help bridge that gap.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            When learners have access to their own books and literacy materials, they are more likely to practice outside of the classroom, take initiative in their learning, and develop a sustained interest in reading. The effects are long-term: better academic results, improved self-esteem, and increased chances of success in life.
